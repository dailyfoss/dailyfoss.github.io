    "Expiring links: Generate unique URLs that automatically expire after set number of views or time period for secure sharing",

    "Password protection: Add additional password requirement to links for extra security when sharing sensitive credentials",
    "View tracking: Monitor when and how many times a link has been accessed to verify delivery and detect unauthorized access",
    "Custom expiration: Set flexible expiration rules based on time duration, view count, or specific date for granular control",
    "File sharing: Share files securely with the same expiring link mechanism, not just passwords and text",
    "No registration: Create and share links without account creation for quick, frictionless secure sharing",
    "Audit trail: Track creation and access history for shared secrets to maintain security compliance and accountability",
