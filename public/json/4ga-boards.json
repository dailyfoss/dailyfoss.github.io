  "description": "4gaBoards is an open-source, self-hostable Kanban-style task-management web app designed for real-time collaboration. It features dark mode, intuitive drag-&-drop boards with multi-level hierarchy (projects → boards → lists → cards → tasks), advanced Markdown editing, import/export support (including from Trello), and simplified wide-screen UI with minimal clutter. Built with React/Redux on the front end and Sails.js/Knex/PostgreSQL on the back end, 4gaBoards is published under the MIT License and supports Docker / Kubernetes deployment.",
