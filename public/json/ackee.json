  "description": "Ackee is an open-source, self-hosted web analytics tool built with Node.js and MongoDB, designed for privacy-conscious users. Unlike many mainstream analytics platforms, it does not rely on tracking cookies or unique user identifiers and puts your data firmly in your own control. It provides a clean, minimal dashboard interface to monitor key metrics (like page views, referrers, session durations) and supports a fully documented GraphQL API for custom integrations.",
